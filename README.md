# WK-8--Flask-Quiz-Game-
Create an Flask API similar to what we learned in class this week that:

Has at least 3 tables, including a user, where the 3 tables are related (can be one to many, many to many, etc)

Implements JSON Web Token Authentication to protect routes (via flask_jwt_extended)

Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality for all tables (eg: user should be able to sign up, login, and change their username, and delete their account)

Test your routes with Postman
